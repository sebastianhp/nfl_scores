Summary of analysis:

1.  (script) Bare distribution. Center of mass is slightly
    off symmetry axis, favoring home team.

2.  (analysis2) Point differential density function: for a given 
	point differenetial, compute home team wins minus away team 
	wins. This analysis shows home team has always had an advantage. 
	(Should I normalize??- yes)

3.  (analysis3) Distrubution of symmetric element ratios. Here we 
    see that home teams are usually favored in lopsided games, and 
	especially in shutouts.
