first need to download score list from pro-football-reference by
going to http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game-scores.htm
and saving the table as a text file (scores.txt). Then, need to 
partition table into two files (scores1.txt, scores2.txt), so that 
when downloading total scores server won't deny access due to too 
many requests. In the past, 600 scores per file seems OK.
Then,

main.py:        does the downloading of scores and saves them to
                fmt_scores1.npy and fmt_scores2.npy. Has to be run 
                twice, for scores1.txt and scores2.txt.

analysis.py:    write the mat_scores.npy file, which combines
                scores1.txt and scores2.txt.
